# SpaceGame
Python Space Game with pygame

This is just a little project for fun :) You need to have Python3 and the Pygame library
installed, you can use "pip install pygame" in most cases. If you want to fiddle with it,
suggest you use PyCharm - the project files are there as well.

To run, normally you'd type "python space.py", or run from within PyCharm or other IDE.

Controls:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Left]  - Go left\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Right] - Go right\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[z]     - Fire the left rocket\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[x]     - Fire the right rocket\

Enjoy :)
