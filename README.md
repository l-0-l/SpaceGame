# SpaceGame
Python Space Game with pygame

This is just a little project for fun :) You need to have Python3 and the Pygame library
installed, you can use "pip install pygame" in most cases. If you want to fiddle with it,
suggest you use PyCharm - the project files are there as well.

To run, normally you'd type "python space.py", or run from within PyCharm or other IDE.

Controls:
    [Left]  - Go left
    [Right] - Go right
    [z]     - Fire the left rocket
    [x]     - Fire the right rocket

Enjoy :)
