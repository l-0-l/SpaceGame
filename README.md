# SpaceGame
A Space Invaders style game with pygame.

This is just a little project for fun. I did it during the pandemic with the goal to learn more about Python classes and OOD in general, heavy refactoring was going on all the time.

You need to have Python3 and the Pygame library installed, you can use "pip install pygame" in most cases. If you want to fiddle with it, suggest you use PyCharm - the project files are there as well. To run, normally you'd type "python space.py", or run from within PyCharm or other IDE.

### Controls:
*   Left - Go left
*   Right - Go right
*   z - Fire the left rocket
*   x - Fire the right rocket

### Credits:
Media files like images and sounds come from various great free resources like https://freesvg.org/ and http://soundimage.org/, some were heavily modified.
